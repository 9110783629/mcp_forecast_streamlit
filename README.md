# GRU-Based Forecasting App for Market Clearing Price (MCP)

This project is a forecasting web application built using a GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) deep learning model.  
It predicts the Market Clearing Price (MCP) for the Indian Energy Exchange (IEX) Day-Ahead Market.

The application is deployed using **Flask** and can be hosted using platforms like **Render** or **AWS EC2**.
